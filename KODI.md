# Note on Kodi
Yes, Kodi is still very relevant in 2025 as a powerful, free, open-source media center, especially for users who want deep customization, local media management, and extensive add-on options, but its reliance on third-party sources for live/streaming content can be inconsistent and requires extra tools like VPNs and debrid services for the best experience, while newer options like Plex or Stremio offer easier interfaces for simpler streaming. 
### Why Kodi Remains Relevant (Pros):
Ultimate Customization: Huge library of skins and add-ons for YouTube, Twitch, podcasts, and even unofficial access to Netflix/Disney+.
Local Media Hub: Excellent for organizing and playing your own movie/music collections from local or network storage.
Open-Source & Free: No cost, no subscriptions, and full control over your media.
Device Versatility: Runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Android, Fire Sticks, Raspberry Pi.
Debrid Integration: Works with debrid services (like Real-Debrid) for reliable, high-quality streaming links, bypassing broken sources. 
### Challenges & Alternatives (Cons):
Complexity: Can be difficult to set up; finding reliable, working add-ons takes effort.
Inconsistent Content: Live TV and streaming add-ons can break or become outdated quickly.
Legality Concerns: While Kodi is legal, using certain add-ons for copyrighted content can be legally risky.
Competition: Plex offers a more polished interface for library management, while Stremio simplifies add-ons. 
### Verdict:
Kodi is highly relevant for tech-savvy users who enjoy tinkering and want total control over their media setup, particularly for local files. For users seeking a simple "plug-and-play" solution for streaming, other platforms might be better, but Kodi's deep ecosystem keeps it a strong contender for dedicated media enthusiasts.

## What Is Kodi?

Kodi entertainment center is an open source, totally free, multi-platform entertainment center with loads of completely unique features and abilities.

Most people use Kodi to watch cable TV for free. Kodi scrapes content from websites that host cable TV streams, allowing you to watch free TV without having to click through tons of banner ads and popups.

With Kodi, you get:

- Free TV
- Free movies
- No setup fees, no monthly fees
- No ads or popups

---

## What Else Can Kodi Do?

Because it's an open source program, anyone who knows how can "remix" Kodi's source code or create addons that enhance its capabilities.

Some Kodi addons can do things like dim the lights in your house, connect to live TV streams, open digital comic book files, display text messages from your smartphone, grab a picture of the pizza guy via your security camera and much, much more.

---

## XBMC vs. Kodi: What's the Difference?

XBMC (Xbox Media Center) is Kodi's old name. The software now known as Kodi was originally designed to play Xbox media files.

Today, though, Kodi does a lot more than just play media. What's more, you can now install Kodi on just about any type of computer under the sun– not just Xbox. That's why Kodi's developers decided to change the name of their software in 2014.

## How to Install Kodi

Most people run Kodi on either MacOS or Windows. However, Kodi also runs on Android, iOS, Linux and even Raspberry Pi. You can even use Kodi as a stand-alone operating system by installing KodiBuntu.

### How to Install Kodi on a PC

Installing Kodi on PC is a cinch. Just download the appropriate installation file from the [Kodi website](https://kodi.tv/), open up the installer, hit next a few times and you're finished.

### How to Install Kodi on a Mac

Installing Kodi on MacOS is also pretty easy. However, after you download the installer, you may have to change your security settings. By default, MacOS prevents you from installing applications from sources outside the App Store.

### How to install Kodi on Android

Now that Kodi is on Google Play, it's super easy to install. Just search for Kodi on Google Play and install it in the same manner as you would any normal Android app.

*If image 'kodiinstall' was referenced, it would appear here.*

### How to install Kodi on iOS

Because Kodi hasn't made it into Apple's App Store yet, you'll have to jailbreak your iPhone and install Cydia first before installing Kodi.

*If image 'kodi-ios' was referenced, it would appear here.*

If you want to find out how to jailbreak your iPhone, your best bet is probably Lifehacker's "always up-to-date" guide. The jailbreak process is complicated and risky, so proceed with caution.

Check out [Kodi's official guide for installing Kodi on iOS](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_Kodi_for_iOS) if you've already set your iPhone free.

### How to install Kodi on Linux

Linux veterans shouldn't have any issues installing Kodi. Just type the following commands into the command line terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-xbmc/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install kodi
```

For more information or to learn how to do advanced stuff like downgrade to an older version of Kodi or install Kodi on rare flavors of Linux, check out [Kodi's official Linux installation guide](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_Kodi_for_Linux).

### How to install Kodi on Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi is a super small computer often used to teach kids about computer science.

Because there are many versions of Raspberry Pi out there, your best bet is to check the [official installation guide](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_Kodi_for_Linux#Raspberry_Pi) and locate your particular model if you're interested in installing Kodi on Raspberry Pi.

### How to install KodiBuntu

KodiBuntu is a minimalistic operating system based on Kodi entertainment center. With KodiBuntu, you don't need a hefty full featured operating system to view media. All you have to do is plug in your KodiBuntu flash drive and turn on your device.

Check out the video below to see what KodiBuntu looks like.

Want to learn how to create a bootable Kodi USB stick? Check out the [official KodiBuntu installation guide](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_KodiBuntu) or watch this video.

### How to Install Kodi on Fire OS

Amazon recently kicked Kodi out of its app store over piracy concerns. As a result, the Kodi team stopped supporting Fire OS. However, you can still install Kodi to your Fire TV stick.

Watch the video below to discover a workaround that will allow you to manually add Kodi to your Amazon Fire TV device.

## Finding Your Way Around the Kodi Interface

On the surface, Kodi's interface looks simple. But it's easy to get lost once you start exploring Kodi's advanced menu options.

If you're a Kodi noob, here are 5 tasks that'll help you get the hang of Kodi's funky menu system. By the time you complete all 5, you'll be able to call yourself a Kodi master.

### 1. Install a free TV addon

The first thing you'll probably want to do once you get Kodi installed is find out how to get free TV. Here are a few of the most popular TV addons for Kodi.

- **USTVNow**
    - As the name suggests, this plugin gives you access to the most popular United States TV stations. With the free flavor of USTVNow Plus, you can watch 7 network television channels: ABC, CBS, CW, Fox, NBC, PBS and My TV.
    - This addon's selection of channels isn't so great, but the good thing about this plugin is that the quality of the feeds is excellent. Also, all the feeds always work every single time. [Find out how to install the USTVNow Plus addon](#).

- **Exodus**
    - When it comes to movies, it's hard to beat Exodus. This addon has a ton of different content available, including the latest movies, and TV shows. The menu allows you to sort the catalogue by genre, network, most popular and more.
    - Like most free movie addons, Exodus links out to other sites and servers to get content. However, the links you'll find on this addon work most of the time. [Find out how to install Exodus](#).

- **Phoenix**
    - Phoenix used to have a massive collection of working TV feeds. Currently, most of the links seem to be out of service– with the exception of the feeds contained in the section called One242415.
    - Hopefully once this addon's creator restores all the broken links, Phoenix will rise from the ashes and rule the world of free streaming TV. [Find out how to install Phoenix](#).

- **UKTVNow (aka USTVAgain)**
    - With this addon, you get 150 cable channels from around the world. The links to the feeds don't always work, but the selection is quite deep. Watch ESPN, Comedy Central, SyFy, the Discovery Channel and more. [Find out how to install UKTVNow](#).

- **iLiVE StreamLive**
    - The best thing about iLiVE StreamLive is that it gives you access to call kinds of live sports channels. With this addon, you get several ESPN channels, Sky, Bien Sport France, Canal+ France, Euro Sport 1 and the NFL Network.
    - iLiVE's navigation system is a bit confusing and the links are somewhat unstable. But if you're looking for a game and can't find it on USTVNow or UKTVNow, it's worth it to try browsing through the iLiVE StreamLive catalogue. [Find out how to install iLiVE StreamLive](#).

**Want to Install More TV Addons?**

Hop over to our article about [the best live TV addons for Kodi](#) to find more information about the most popular TV addons Kodi has to offer.

### 2. Import all your movies into your Kodi library

To import all your movies, go to videos → files → add videos → browse. Then, navigate to the location of your movies on your hard drive. After that, select ok on the right side of the screen.

*If image 'screenshot-2016-09-21-15-22-53' was referenced, it would appear here.*

Next, name the source to whatever you want ("movies", for example.) Click ok again to arrive at the set content screen pictured below.

Once you're at the set content screen, click the arrows until you get to movies.

*If image 'screenshot-2016-09-21-15-25-33' was referenced, it would appear here.*

Each content type is associated with a scraper. Scrapers use the internet to grab information about your content. For example, the movies content type grabs title, genre and other types of info from themoviedb.org.

*If image 'screenshot-2016-09-21-15-28-41' was referenced, it would appear here.*

Once you scan a few movies, you'll see a new button appear on your main menu: library.

*If image 'screenshot-2016-09-21-15-34-00' was referenced, it would appear here.*

After your movie content is scanned, some interesting options will become available to you. For example, if you go to library → movies → actors you'll see a list of all the actors that appear in the movies that you have stored on your hard drive.

*If image 'screenshot-2016-09-21-15-39-33' was referenced, it would appear here.*

### 3. Add some official addons

Kodi addons are a lot like apps. Addons allow you to add additional functionality to your Kodi installation.

A small percentage of addons are made by Kodi developers. However, most Kodi addons are produced by the Kodi community.

To check out the official Kodi addons, just pick a media type (music, pictures or videos) then click addons → get more.

When you select an addon, its logo and a description of what it does will appear on the right side of the screen. Just click install once you've identified an interesting official addon. After the installation is finished, click open to take your addon for a spin.

*If image 'screenshot-2016-09-21-15-46-49' was referenced, it would appear here.*

### 4. Install a repository (aka "repo")

Files needed to install community addons are stored in virtual containers called software repositories. Repositories make it easy for Kodi developers that don't have personal websites to share their addons with the world. The official Kodi repositories are installed by default.

A super repository is a giant repository that contains lots of smaller repositories. One of the biggest super repositories is called SuperRepo. Once you hook Kodi up to SuperRepo, you'll gain access to a ton of awesome addons.

Here's how to SuperRepo in 3 easy steps:

**Step 1: Add the file source**

To install SuperRepo, first add the file source by navigating to system → file manager → add source. Then, paste in the SuperRepo URL: `http://srp.nu/` and set the name of the file source as SuperRepo.

**Step 2: Install the repository**

2. Now that you've setup SuperRepo as a source, you can install the repository itself. To get to the repository file, navigate to system → settings → addons → install from zip → SuperRepo. At this point, you should see a bunch of folders with strange sounding names.

*If image 'jarvis' was referenced, it would appear here.*

The names of the folders are for different Kodi builds. Each build name is associated with a version number.

If you're not sure what version of Kodi you have, go to system → system info and find out your build number.

*If image 'screenshot-2016-09-21-14-52-54' was referenced, it would appear here.*

Unfortunately, the name of the Kodi build isn't listed on this screen– just the number. However, once you've got your build number a quick Google search will reveal the name of your Kodi build name. Kodi 16.1 is also known as Kodi Jarvis.

Once you figure out the name of your build, go back into SuperRepo and click the appropriate folder. Then, go into the all folder and click `superrepo.kodi.[build name].zip` to install the full repository.

**Step 3: Install a SuperRepo addon**

Now that you've installed SuperRepo, you can go to system → settings → addons → install from repository → superrepo all to browse the SuperRepo addon catalogue.

*If image 'screenshot-2016-09-21-15-07-50' was referenced, it would appear here.*

### 5. Create an addon bundle

SuperRepo and other large super repositories allow you to create addon bundles. Bundles allow you to easily share your favorite addons with your friends. Check out the video below to learn how to create an addon bundle using SuperRepo.

---

## Useful Kodi Terminology

Here are a few Kodi related terms you might run into while browsing Kodi blogs and websites.

### MCE remotes

Kodi was originally developed for devices that use remote controllers. That's why certain types of remote controllers are compatible with Kodi right out of the box. If you buy a remote controller for your Kodi device that follows the MCE standard, you won't have to program it at all.

### "Fully loaded" Kodi boxes

Some people sell media devices that come with pre-loaded addons that allow users to access pirated TV streams. These devices are often called fully loaded Kodi boxes.

Currently, it's technically not against the law to sell fully loaded Kodi boxes. However, companies that own entertainment content are pressuring governments to create new laws.

In September of 2016, UK resident Brian Thompson was prosecuted for selling fully loaded Kodi boxes. If the court finds him guilty, fully loaded Kodi boxes could soon be outlawed in the UK. In Canada, the Federal Court has ordered electronics vendors to stop selling fully loaded Kodi boxes until a decision about the legality of the boxes is reached.

### Context menu

Kodi's context menu allows you to do useful things like change the content type of a file and add an item to a queue.

To get to Kodi's context menu on a Mac, click and hold the mouse button for about two seconds. When you release the button, the context menu will appear. If you're using a PC, right click to reveal the context menu. If you're using a MCE remote, press the guide button.

### Copyright troll

So-called "copyright trolls" are lawyers or companies that troll people who have downloaded pirated content by sending them threatening messages. Occasionally, copyright trolls do follow through on their threats and take illegal downloaders to court.

As long as you avoid Kodi addons that download torrents and other files that contain unlicensed content, you won't have to worry about copyright trolls. Generally copyright trolls can only go after people who download pirated content, not those who choose to stream it.

### VPN

VPN stands for virtual private network. VPNs block ISPs and government regulatory agencies from spying on what you do while you browse the web or use Kodi.

## More Cool Things You Can Do With Kodi Addons

- **Connect Kodi to your security camera.** A Kodi addon called Security CAM Overlay can pause your movie and show you a picture when your security camera detects movement.
- **Dim your house lights.** Download the CinemaVision addon if you have a Philips Hue lighting system and you want to have Kodi dim or turn off your lights when you start a movie.
- **Check the weather.** Navigate to settings → weather from the main menu and set up a weather news provider to have Kodi keep you informed about weather conditions in your area.
- **Set up a Kodi profile for your kids.** If you don't want your kids watching violent or inappropriate movies, set up a profile for them to use that blocks access to the content that you'd rather them not see.
- **Create your own TV channel.** Pseudo TV allows you to build a TV channel out of content on your hard drive.
- **Display text messages from your smartphone.** Install Pushbullet to hook Kodi up to your smartphone. With Pushbullet, you can send notifications or whatever you're looking at on your phone directly Kodi.
- **Play retro video games.** If you have a collection of retro ROM files, you can use Kodi to play them with the official Kodi addon called ROM Collection Browser.
- **Read comic books.** Kodi has built-in support CBR (Comic Book Reader) files. Point Kodi to your digital comic book collection by going to pictures → add pictures → browse.

# Switch Back to the Original Kodi Skin (17.0 Krypton or Above)

**Date:** 02/04/2017  
**Share Count:** 3

Depending on your method of installation, you might have woken up this week to see that Kodi has automatically updated itself to the latest version, with a whole new interface. This might be too much for some of you to handle for the time being, but don't worry the change can be easily reversed, and you can continue enjoying Kodi using the old default interface that you have grown to love.

This procedure will allow you to switch from the new default Kodi skin called **Estuary**, back to the old default skin which was called **Confluence**. The change is fairly simple and shouldn't take more than a minute. Once this is complete, you'll be able to continue to enjoy the Kodi interface you're used to, until you're feeling adventurous to finally try something new that is.

**Required:** Kodi 17.0 Krypton or Above

## Steps:

1.  **Navigate** to the small Settings cogwheel at the top of the vertical menu bar.
2.  **Select** the Interface settings tab.
3.  **Click** on the Skin field that displays Estuary by default.
4.  **Click** on the "Get more…" button.
5.  **Select** the Confluence skin.
6.  **Wait** a few seconds for the Confluence skin to download.
7.  **You're done!** Press the Yes button to keep the skin change.

It might not seem that way right now, but the Estuary skin really is great and will prove itself to be the future of Kodi, so you might want to try it out from time to time and see what it has to offer.

# Best Kodi Bollywood Addons for Desi, Hindi and Punjabi Films – Top 8

**By Sam C. - March 8, 2017**

[Share on Facebook](#) [Tweet on Twitter](#)

*![](kodi bollywood addons)*

Although American and British films are universally popular, Bollywood is still big in and outside of India. Many Kodi Bollywood addons are designed just for Bollywood fans, streaming great content direct from India. And while some of the best Bollywood addons for Kodi are Bollywood-specific, there are many well-known addons that cover the gamut from Bollywood to Hollywood. This list should help get you started on your search for everything Bollywood has to offer.

To ensure effectiveness, we tested each of these addons. Our process involved first installing each add-on to ensure that the installation process works. We then went through each addon's menus to determine whether they contained either a Bollywood section or language section that connected to Bollywood films. Finally, we tested several links from different sections to ensure that there are functional links streaming from the addon. While we cannot guarantee that every link works, we can verify that a) the add-on installation process is effective (as evidenced by the screencaps), b) the addons have a good selection of Bollywood films and c) that there are at least some links that work via the random selection process.

We also tested over two dozen addons through the search process. This includes some of the more popular addons, some addons others were suggesting, and many addons we decided to give a try that others weren't suggesting in other locations. Hopefully, this list helps connect you to great Bollywood content!

*Note: All tutorials are done in the Confluence skin with 16.1 Jarvis. Additionally, you may see some zip files identified as "indian-repository.aj-addons-x.x.x.zip". The "x.x.x" is to indicate that the version number may have changed between now and the time you are reading this guide.*

Please read our disclaimer before proceeding.

## Reminder

We highly recommend using a VPN while watching Bollywood addons on Kodi. Kodi users have been known to receive copyright infringement notices for streaming movies, sports, and TV shows through various addons. If you would like to keep your streaming habits private, our recommendation is IPVanish – a complete privacy solution for Kodi users.

## How to Watch Bollywood Films on Kodi – A Video Guide

Before we get down to business, you may want to consider following along with the accompanying video guide to this article below. Everything you need to know from this article, compressed into just over ten minutes!

---

## Exodus

*![](Exodus German)*

[Click here to access our Exodus installation guide.](#)

Exodus is popular for a lot of reasons. It scrapes a lot of different streams, helping solve the headache-inducing struggle to find a working stream. But it's also well-organized, even for Bollywood films. While Exodus does not have a dedicated "Bollywood" section, you can find Hindi, Desi and Punjabi films by searching by language. The language search will also bring up non-Bollywood films in the mix. However, the selection of Bollywood films is extremely large, especially for new movies.

*If you find that Exodus is not working, we suggest you still download this addon. We recommend you head to our Exodus page and scroll to the bottom to learn more about why it may not be working right now. Long story short, the addon recently changed hands and is going through redevelopment. Expect the content to return soon.*

---

## ZemTV

*![](Zemtv)*

[Click here to access our ZemTV installation guide.](#)

There are really no two ways about it. ZemTV is well-designed Kodi Bollywood Addon. It's one of those rare occasions where you can find American films and television on the add-on, but where the emphasis is placed on Hindi, Desi and Punjabi entertainment. There are both live TV channels and films available through the add-on. You likely won't exhaust everything this add-on has to offer anytime soon. A slight improvement to this add-on would be adding in a much more categorized movies section. As it is, the movies are simply listed, and not even in alphabetical order. The organization is somewhat of a mess, which detracts significantly from the add-on given it has some really good options.

**Updates:** 3/8/2017

ZemTV used to be better than it is, however. With recent testing, we've found that many of the movie sections are not much to write home about, with empty folders for those sections. However, you should still make this your go-to addon if you're looking to get live TV. ZemTV has an absolutely huge selection of TV channels coming out of India, with fast loading and very good streaming quality.

---

## Aftershock

[Click here to access our Aftershock installation guide.](#)

There's a good chance that Aftershock will have the TV shows and movies that your're looking for. The two addons are extremely similar, particularly in offering films with a large number of Indo-European and Austro-Asiatic languages. The options here are pretty solid, so you'll likely want to add Aftershock to your list if you've already included the others on your install list. Movies are well organized here. This goes a long way to aid those who don't exactly know what they're looking for. However, the categories could use a little more refinement. Still, this is a boon for the add-on that should help make it a go-to option for anyone hoping to find new stuff.

---

## ApaliMarathi

ApaliMarathi is not quite Bollywood, but offers some very interesting movie selections from this unique region of India. The movie quality is good as are the stream options. Be warned that subtitles are not common here. If you don't speak the language but you're hoping to check out some of the great movie choices here, you might be a bit left out or lost. Alternatively, if you're ok watching movies without understanding the language and context, feel free. For Marathi speakers: enjoy!

Note: This add-on is located in the Fusion Installer TVADDONS.AG.

To install this addon, do the following:

1.  Go to "Settings".
2.  Head to "Add-ons".
3.  Click on "Install from zip file".
4.  Click on your Fusion zip file.
5.  Go to "Kodi-repos".
6.  Click on "International".
7.  Click on "indian.repository.penguine.x.x.x.zip".
8.  Return to the "Add-ons" screen.
9.  Click on "Install from repository".
10. Find your "Penguine" repository.
11. In the repo, go to "Video add-ons". Then, install ApaliMarathi.
12. You will find your file from your home screen, and then "Videos > Add-ons".

*![](Marathi install screencap)*
*![](Marathi films)*

## MalabarTalkies

MalabarTalkies is not particularly well known among English speakers. This is because the add-on is almost 100% for Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi, and Malayalam speakers. You'll find a very wide range of options in this add-on, with a good amount of interesting features. The worship songs and worship messages sections are incredibly unique. This has one of the largest libraries we've seen among the others on our list, making it a wholly valuable addition for anyone looking for good options.

**Additional notes on MalabarTalkies:**

We found a lot of dead links. However, we also found a lot of movies that require you to log in to an external website. You'll need to sign up for an account with those websites in this case, although the account sign up is free. Once you do so, you can log into those accounts through the addon, at which point your access to the streams should work.

To install this add-on, follow this process:

1.  Go to "Settings".
2.  Click on "Add-ons".
3.  Go to"Install from zip file".
4.  Head to your Fusion zip file.
5.  Go to "xbmc-repos".
6.  Go to "International".
7.  Scroll down until you find "Indian-repository.gbzygil-IndianMovies.zip". Install it.
8.  Return to the "Add-ons" screen.
9.  Head to "Install from repository".
10. Find the new repo: "gbzygil's XBMC Addons".
11. Go through "Video Add-ons" and find "MalabarTalkies". Install it.

*![](MalabarTalkies install screecap)*

## TV on Desi Zone

You'll find TV on Desi Zone gives a good variety of options for both casual Bollywood fans and hardcore fans alike. This is one of the few addons that takes special care to give you a more interesting viewing experience with the visual layout. The result is a somewhat slower loading time, however, so this add-on is not quite the right option for the impatient. However, you get a lot of great options here. Although this Kodi Bollywood addon focuses primarily on tv shows and channels (with a smattering of American ones thrown in), you'll be able to find movies littered throughout by trying out a few channels. This isn't the best option you can find, but it's a great one, and it's nice to see an addon with a different take on the user interface.

To install this add-on, follow these instructions:

1.  Head over to your home screen.
2.  Click on the "System" tab.
3.  Select "Add-ons".
4.  Click on "Install from zip file".
5.  Find your Fusion file.
6.  Go to "xmbc-repos".
7.  Click on "International".
8.  Scroll down until you get to "indian-repository.aj-addons-x.x.x.zip".
9.  Head back to the "Settings > Add-ons" screen.
10. Find "aj add-ons". In the "Video add-ons" section of the repo, find "TV on Desi Zone".

## Phoenix

For the most part, Phoenix is not going yo be your best resource for Bollywood. However, Phoenix does do one thing that will get you there: providing access to ZemTV. You will find a link to ZemTV content from the "Phoenix TV" section in this addon. That said, you may actually find other Bollywood films scattered throughout this addon. You can check out our more detailed explanation regarding the different sections in Phoenix to find out where and why that might be the case. Simply put, Phoenix has a lot of content listed, and it's quite often not very well organized.

## cCloud TV

[Click here to access out cCloud TV Installation Guide.](#)

If you're looking for some excellent streaming TV content, you'll find it with cCloud TV. This addon primarily focuses on American content but does host a good amount of Hindi channels as well. We even found some good Punjabi channels in the mix. Some of the channels coming out of India are also in English, so don't be fooled by seeing "Enbglish" next to the channel name. Instead, when looking through the international section, just check the country of origin. You'll see "IN" in parenthesis next to the channel name. Those channels are all coming out of India. We counted how many channels are offered through here, and it's over 85. This makes cCloud TV one of the best sources for potential Bollywood films and TV shows.

## Finding Great Bollywood Content: A Few Tips

Finding Bollywood content on Kodi is not always the most intuitive, especially with so many addons focusing specifically on American and British content. However, we can provide a few tips for those who really need to find great content, and are generally frustrated with the search process.

1.  **Download super-repositories and look for regional-specific repos.**
    This was the primary method we used in our search process. Looking for regional repositories helps the search process. But you won't find those specific repos easily unless you download a few super-repositories first. We found the Fusion (now Indigo) super repository extremely helpful for this, as it provides sections just for different region and languages. You may also find success with SuperRepo, which houses many of the same repositories and addons that Fusion does.

2.  **Be willing to try and fail.**
    Quite honestly, a lot of addons really don't work. If you're doing your own investigation, be prepared to spend a lot of time with addons that don't do anything. They may look good and seem like they carry great content, but be sure to check links — and be ready for a lot of disappointment. Many addons are either created and never actually finished, or simply poorly designed in the first place. Furthermore, many addons may have been working at one point, but do not work now. Content streams come and go, so addons that are not updated regularly are far more likely to have an endless stream of dead links.

3.  **Share great addons if you find them.**
    Found a few great addons that do work and provide great Bollywood content? Don't see it on our list? Please do let us know! We'll post it up here on the site so that others can find out about it! There are far more addons out there waiting to be discovered, so feel free to share any good finds that you may come across. We'll be happy to test them and add them to our list.

# Best Chinese Kodi Addons – How to Watch Chinese Movies and TV Shows on Kodi

**By Alex M. - November 13, 2016**

[Share on Facebook](#) [Tweet on Twitter](#)

*![](chinese-kodi-addons)*

Binged through all your favorite shows and still starved for entertainment?  If so, here's a suggestion: check out some Chinese movies and TV shows on Kodi.

Chinese dramas are particularly hot right now.  CCTV's dramatic series Scarlet Heart has earned a huge international following thanks in large part to charismatic performances from starlet Liu Shi Shi.  Also, 2015's Love Me If You Dare— a police procedural Chinese drama centered around the relationship between a genius detective (Wallace Huo) and his assistant Jian Yao (Sandra Ma)– is racking up millions of views.

Despite the growing popularity of Chinese dramas in the east, most networks outside of Asia just don't broadcast them.  However, Kodi fans have several different options for tuning in.  Links to Chinese movies and TV shows can be found on addons like Halow Live TV, Kissasian, Azdrama.net for Kodi, CCTV Replay and DramaGo.

I recently tested out a handful of Chinese Kodi addons to see which one had the best selection of movies and TV shows to offer.  Though each addon I looked at had notable strengths and weaknesses, in the end I felt that DramaGo was the overall best of the bunch.

## None of Halow Live TV's Chinese feeds work

Out of all the TV addons that I've tried out so far, Halow Live TV had the biggest selection of international TV feeds.  That's why when I decided to see if I could find some live TV feeds from China, Halow was my first choice.

However, it didn't take me long to realize that that the Chinese section of this addon is deeply in need of an update.

My first clue that Halow's Chinese TV page might not be so great was the fact that whoever put it together misspelled "China."

*![](screen-shot-2016-11-13-at-2-19-37-pm)*

None of the TV channel streams that I tried on the "Chinia" page worked.  The broken links didn't surprise me, because the Chinese section hasn't been updated since November of 2015.

*![](screen-shot-2016-11-13-at-2-33-10-pm)*

### How to install the Halow Live TV addon

First, download the Halow Live TV repository file to your desktop and then install it by navigating to system → settings → addons → install from zip file.

Wait for the installation complete message, then go to system → settings → addons → install from repository → halow repository → video addons → hallow live TV → install.

---

## KissAsian: still works if you use a patch

KissAsian used to be one of the best addons for anime, Asian TV shows and movies.  However, the developer stopped updating the project months ago.  As a result, the addon has fallen into disrepair.

*![](screen-shot-2016-11-13-at-3-13-38-pm)*

You can still browse KissAsian's content, but you can't play any of it without the unofficial patch.

*![](screen-shot-2016-11-13-at-3-38-54-pm)*

The fact that KissAsian is no longer being updated is a major disappointment.  However, I still like this addon's huge selection and search functionality.

If you still want to try it out KissAsian, you can find it in the video addons section of SuperRepo.

### How to install KissAsian for Kodi

To install SuperRepo first download the SuperRepo zip file to your desktop.

Then, install SuperRepo on Kodi by navigating to  system → settings → addons → install from zip file.

Wait for the installation complete message, then go to system → settings → addons → install from repository → superrepo repositories [jarvis][v7] → superrepo category video [jarvis][v7] → install

Next, go to system → settings → addons → install from repository → superrepo category video [jarvis][v7] → video addons → kissasian → install

---

## Azdrama: easy to use, but no search functionality

I like the way this addon's main menu neatly divides its content into 10 sections: recent updates, HK Dramas, HK Movies, Korean Dramas, Mainland Chinese Dramas, Taiwanese Dramas, Korean Variety Shows, Japanese Dramas and Movies.

*![](screen-shot-2016-11-13-at-4-03-13-pm)*

A massive amount of content from many different Asian countries is available through this addon.  But what I don't like about Azdrama is that it's missing one very essential feature: search.  Without search, there's no way to find what you want to watch without scrolling through pages and pages of shows.  On the plus side, the majority of this addon's links all seem to be live.

If you just want to watch some popular Asian dramas, Azdrama is worth a look.  But if you're looking for a particular show, you might be annoyed by the lack of search functionality.

Azdrama is easy to install because it comes in a self-contained zip file.

### How to install Azdrama for Kodi

Download the zip file to your desktop.

Then, install from within Kodi by navigating to system → settings → addons → install from zip file.

---

## CCTV Replay: lots of live feeds, but no English subs

If you speak Chinese, CCTV Replay is the perfect Chinese TV addon for you.  With this addon, you can access to 15 different Chinese cable TV channels.

*![](screen-shot-2016-11-13-at-4-23-48-pm)*

Of course, if you don't speak fluent Chinese you'll probably be more than a bit lost.  There's no way to download subtitles to read as you watch.

*![](screen-shot-2016-11-13-at-4-28-57-pm)*

Like Azdrama, CCTV Replay also comes in a self-contained zip.

### How to install CCTV Replay

First, download the zip file to your desktop.

Then install CCTV Replay from within Kodi by navigating to system → settings → addons → install from zip file.

## The best Kodi addon for watching Chinese dramas: DramaGo

DramaGo is the only Chinese Kodi addon I've seen that (almost) has it all: a dedicated developer, a huge selection, search capability and working links as well as a well-organized menu system.  The only thing missing is links to live feeds.  But if you just want to watch prerecorded Chinese movies and shows, this addon has everything you need.

The video quality of most of the shows and movies is listed as SD, but the majority of the content looks very crisp.  Also, almost all of the videos are subtitled in English.

*![](screen-shot-2016-11-13-at-5-09-42-pm)*

I really liked DramaGo's main menu.  It has 12 logically organized subsections:

- Search Movies
- Search TV Shows
- Recently Added Movies
- Recently Added TV Shows
- Favorites
- Movies A-Z
- TV Shows A-Z
- Movie Genres
- TV Show Genres
- Top Movies
- Top TV Shows
- Korean Drama HD

Here's what it looks like:

*![](screen-shot-2016-11-13-at-4-47-39-pm)*

As you can see, the main menu is nothing fancy– but it is logical and all the options work, including search.  I especially liked that movies and TV shows both got their own search bar.

The two "genres" sections are huge and contain lots of categories– probably over 100 different ones, in all.  Here are just a few of the most unusual options on the list:

- Death game
- Royal family
- Corporate
- My home's honey jar
- Time travel
- Adoption
- Elderly
- Maritime

### Why I think DramaGo is the best Chinese movie/TV addon out there today

With the exception of Halow Live TV, the other Chinese TV/Movie addons I reviewed before I found DramaGo brought at least one good feature to the table.  Azdrama.net for Kodi was pretty good overall, but it lacked search.  KissAsian was also strong but does not work without an unofficial patch.  CCTV Replay had lots of good live feeds, but no links to specific shows.  DramaGo, however, has no weak points aside from one minor flaw– its lack of live TV feeds.

Like KissAsian, DramaGo can also be found in the video addons section of SuperRepo.

### How to download DramaGo for Kodi

To install SuperRepo first download the SuperRepo zip file to your desktop.

Then, install SuperRepo on Kodi by navigating to  system → settings → addons → install from zip file.

Wait for the installation complete message, then go to system → settings → addons → install from repository → superrepo repositories [jarvis][v7] → superrepo category video [jarvis][v7] → install

Next, go to system → settings → addons → install from repository → superrepo category video [jarvis][v7] → video addons → dramago → install

To make Icdrama work again you just need to install the new icdrama update version 1.2.5. Once I have updated to the new version the links are working again on my kodi.
