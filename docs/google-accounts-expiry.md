Google will deactivate and delete a personal account if it has not been used or signed into for at least two years. This policy, which began enforcement in December 2023, applies only to personal Google Accounts and does not affect accounts for schools, businesses, or other organizations.

## Deletion Timeline and Process

*   **Two-Year Inactivity:** An account is deemed inactive if there has been no activity across Google services for 24 consecutive months.
*   **Advance Notification:** Before an account is deleted, Google sends multiple notifications to both the account email address and any provided recovery email. These reminders are typically sent at least 8 months before any action is taken.
*   **Phased Rollout:** Deletions are rolling out throughout 2025 in a phased approach, often targeting accounts that were created and never used again first.

## How to Keep Your Account Active

To prevent deletion, you must perform at least one of these actions while signed in at least once every two years:
*   Reading or sending an email.
*   Using Google Drive.
*   Watching a YouTube video.
*   Using Google Search.
*   Downloading an app from the Google Play Store.
*   Using "Sign in with Google" for a third-party app or service.

## Key Exceptions

An account will not be deleted, even if inactive for two years, if it meets any of the following:
*   It has been used to make a purchase of a current or ongoing Google product, service, or subscription.
*   It contains a gift card with a monetary balance.
*   It owns a published app or game with active financial transactions in the Play Store.
*   It manages an active minor account via Family Link.
*   It has purchased a digital item like a movie or book.

**Note on Google Ads:** Specifically for Google Ads, canceled accounts will be permanently deleted just six months after cancellation if they are not reactivated.

#  Your account will still be deactivated and deleted if you do not personally sign in, even if others are actively using folders you shared.

The "activity" required to keep an account alive must be performed by the account owner while signed in. Third-party access to your shared files does not count as your own activity.

## Impact on Shared Content

If your personal account is deleted due to inactivity:

*   **Total Data Loss:** All content and data associated with that account, including the shared folder and its files, will be permanently deleted.
*   **Loss of Access for Others:** Anyone you shared the folder with will lose access immediately once the account is removed.
*   **Orphaned Files:** In some cases, if others moved their own files into your shared folder, those files might become "orphaned" (without a parent folder) for those users, but they will no longer be able to see your folder structure.

## How to Protect Your Shared Data

To ensure your shared collaborators do not lose access, you should take one of the following actions before the two-year mark:

*   **Sign In:** Simply logging into the account once every two years resets the clock.
*   **Transfer Ownership:** Transfer ownership of the shared folder or critical files to an active user.
*   **Back Up Locally:** Use Google Takeout to download a copy of your data.
*   **Use Shared Drives (Workspace Only):** If you are using a work or school account, files in a "Shared Drive" are owned by the organization, not the individual, and typically remain even if the creator's account is deleted. Note: This does not apply to standard personal "My Drive" folders.

# Options to keep Google account active

There is no official app designed specifically to automatically "ping" or periodically activate a Google account to prevent deletion. Using third-party automation tools or scripts is generally not recommended, as automated logins can sometimes trigger security flags, potentially leading to your account being locked for suspicious activity.

Instead of an app, you should use Google's built-in tools and standard practices to manage your account's status.

### Use Google's Inactive Account Manager

The most reliable "set-it-and-forget-it" tool is Google's own Inactive Account Manager. It does not "activate" your account, but it protects your data if you remain inactive.

*   **Set a Timeout:** Choose a period of inactivity (3, 6, 12, or 18 months).
*   **Trusted Contacts:** Designate up to 10 people to be notified if your account reaches that limit.
*   **Data Sharing:** You can choose to share specific data (like your Google Drive files) with these contacts so they don't lose access even if your account is eventually deleted.

### Built-in "Automatic" Activity

You can keep an account active without manual logins by linking it to a service that maintains a heartbeat:

*   **Active Subscriptions:** If you use the account to pay for a recurring subscription (like Google One, a news site, or an app), Google considers the account active.
*   **Android Device Link:** Simply keeping the account signed in on an Android device that you use regularly is often enough, as background syncs and check-ins count as activity.
*   **YouTube Channel:** As of 2025, Google has stated they do not currently plan to delete accounts that have uploaded YouTube videos.

### Recommended Manual Habit

Because you only need to sign in once every two years, the safest method is to set a recurring reminder on your primary calendar or phone for every 12–18 months. When the reminder goes off:

*   Sign into the account.
*   Perform a simple task like a Google Search or opening one email in Gmail.
